 * Every problem, warning and refusal a builder can see, with a stable `code`, the sentence (or the

 * the code next to each sentence (`code` beside `error`, `issues[].code` beside check problems,
 * `problems[].code` in the health panel), the web app links each message to its entry on the
 * troubleshooting page by code (`#<code>`), and the docs page is built from `PROBLEMS`.

 * Codes never change once published: a new message gets a new entry. `match` is how a sentence
 * the services already produce is recognised, so codes don't depend on every call site.
