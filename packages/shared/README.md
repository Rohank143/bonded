# @bonded/shared

Schemas, contract ABIs, chain configs and signing types shared by Bonded's contracts, Arena, API,
SDK and runner.

- **Agent contract**: the tools an agent under test can call (`AGENT_TOOLS`, their JSON schemas),
  `ArenaAgent`, `AgentTask` and `ToolResult`.
- **Agent URL protocol** (also at `@bonded/shared/agent-url`, without the ABIs): the messages the
  gateway POSTs to an agent's URL, and signing and verifying them (`signAgentUrlRequest`,
  `verifyAgentUrlRequest`, `AgentUrlReplayGuard`).
- **Runner protocol**: the messages between the Arena Gateway and `@bonded/runner` (zod schemas),
  and the environment a runner gives an agent (`episodeEnv`).
- **Mandates and attestations**: `EvmMandate`, `mandateHash`, the attestation's EIP-712 types.
- **ABIs** for the Bonded contracts, generated from the Foundry build.
- **Chains and deployments**: the networks Bonded runs on and its contract addresses there.

ESM only, Node 22 or later. See the [Bonded repository](https://github.com/ddboy19912/bonded) for
the protocol and its documentation.
