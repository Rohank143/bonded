# Bonded: working rules

Read `docs/PLAN.md` for the product and the 16-day build plan. (It is not in the repo yet; `docs/HARBINGER-PLAN.md` is the current attack-library master plan, and `docs/HARBINGER.md` documents the attacker engine.)

## Git workflow

- `main` is the stable branch. Never push work directly to `main`.
- Every piece of work goes on its own branch, then into `main` through a pull request. The founder reviews and merges every PR. Never merge your own PR.
- Open the PR as soon as the work on a branch is pushed. Don't wait to be asked.
- Branch names are short and descriptive: `day-01-scaffold`, `mandate-vault`, `fix-claims-waterfall`.
  - Never prefix a branch with `claude/`.
  - Never use random or auto-generated names (e.g. `inspiring-mayer-qognwt`).
- Don't delete branches unless the founder asks.
- Commit authorship: the founder is the only author. Author and committer are both `ddboy19912 <ddboy19912@gmail.com>` (set with `git config user.name` / `user.email` in the repo). No `Co-Authored-By` or `Claude-Session` trailers in commit messages. Existing commits are not re-authored.
- PR descriptions say what changed, why, how it was tested, and what the founder should check.
- GitHub Actions is currently blocked by an account billing issue, so the CI workflow is paused (manual trigger only; see the comment in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to turn it back on). Until that's fixed, run the full pipeline on a fresh clone before opening a PR (format check, `abis:check`, typecheck, lint, tests including the Arena's integration tests, `forge fmt --check`, `forge test`) and paste the results in the PR description.
- Treat review-bot findings (e.g. CodeRabbit) as bug reports: verify each one, fix what's real, and reply on the thread.

## Writing style

- Say "Section 20", never "§20".
- Plain language in docs, commit messages and PR descriptions.

## Engineering

- Payouts and pass/fail are decided by deterministic, on-chain logic. AI output (Claude, Laya) is advisory only.
- Tests go in the same commit as the code they test.
- The on-chain attestation format is frozen (`BondedTypes.Attestation`, its typehash, the shared schema and ABI). New rating detail goes in the report, which `reportHash` commits to. Bump `ATTACK_LIBRARY_VERSION` when attacks, seeds or scoring change (docs/SCORING.md).
- Batch library changes into releases. New attacks, seeds and twins go in the staged folders and are reported as findings, not scores. They move into ratings, with one version bump and one re-rate, only in a release the founder schedules. Don't plan a "move into ratings" step per feature (docs/SCORING.md, "Releases: batch the bumps").
- Keep metrics honest: report held-out numbers and list the assumptions next to them.
