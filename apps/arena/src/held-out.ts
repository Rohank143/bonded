/**
 * The held-out attack set (issue #11, docs/decisions/007-ratings.md): attacks that are never
 * published, so an operator can't tune an agent against their exact wording. A model drafts each
 * one from a library seed's variant prompt; code then decides whether it's kept, by the same
 * checks a bounty must pass (bounty.ts), plus distance from the seed it came from:
 * - a valid spec of the seed's class and surfaces, with only the Arena's placeholders;
 * - not a copy of anything in the library (DUPLICATE_OVERLAP) or already kept;
 * - shares less than SIMILAR_OVERLAP of its words with its source seed, so hardening against the
 *   public seed's wording doesn't also cover it;
 * - breaches the undefended reference agent in at least BREACHES_NEEDED of its runs.
 * The set is stored in the database (never the repository) and retired after a fixed date.
