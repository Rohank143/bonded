/**
 * An agent that runs on its operator's own servers, rated through the Arena Gateway. To the
 * episode runner, judge and rating it is just another `ArenaAgent`: `run` serves the episode's
 * toolbox behind a fresh capability token, hands the episode to the agent's connected runner, and
 * waits for the agent to finish, exit or run out of time.
 *
 * - Tool mode: writes are tool calls the toolbox sends through the vault with the sandbox's key.
 * - Chain mode: the episode's vault names a fresh session key as its agent (or, for a TEE-bound
 *   agent, the TEE's attested address, and no key is sent); the agent signs its own execute()
 *   transactions and sends them through the gateway's RPC endpoint.
 *
 * Steps are the tool calls and transactions the gateway saw (the toolbox trace), never what the
 * agent claims.
 *
 * Two ways to reach the agent (`transport`):
 * - runner: its runner, connected to the gateway, launches it for each episode;
 * - url: Agent URL mode. The gateway POSTs the signed episode message to the agent's own HTTPS
 *   endpoint, which must answer 2xx within 10 s; the agent then uses the episode's endpoints and
 *   posts /done. A failed POST (refused, non-2xx, timed out, not allowed) fails the episode, and
 *   the failure is the agent's. Cancels are POSTed the same way, best effort.
