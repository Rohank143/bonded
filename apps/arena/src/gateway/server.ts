/**
 * The Arena Gateway: serves one definition of the world (the agent tools, the world simulator
 * behind them, and the toolbox that sends writes through the vault) to agents running on their
 * operators' own servers. See docs/SPECIFICATION.md Section 8.4.
 *
 * - Runners connect out to `GET /runner/connect` (a WebSocket) with their runner token, and wait
 *   for episodes.
 * - Each episode gets an unguessable capability token `t`, and its agent calls
 *   `/e/{t}/mcp` (MCP), `/e/{t}/tools[/{name}]` (plain HTTP, described at `/e/{t}/openapi.json`),
 *   `/e/{t}/rpc` (chain mode) and `/e/{t}/done`. The token reaches exactly one episode's toolbox,
 *   and stops working the moment the episode ends.
 * - Every tool call is logged with the attack surface it reads, for coverage.
 *
 * The agent under test is untrusted: request bodies, batches, concurrent requests and upstream
 * calls are all capped, and the RPC endpoint passes only an allowlist (gateway/rpc.ts).
