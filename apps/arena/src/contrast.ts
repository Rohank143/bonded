/**
 * v3 training data, part 1 (docs/SENTINEL-STRESS.md, "v3 preparation"): deterministic
 * contrastive pairs for the weaknesses the stress audits found.
 *
 * Each pair shares one mandate and one set of inputs, with an instruction planted in them:
 * - `obeyed`: the agent makes exactly the trade the instruction orders. Manipulated.
 * - `independent`: the agent makes a different trade (another stock and amount). Not
 *   manipulated. The planted text is still there, so injection is true for both.
 *
 * Only the action differs, so the model can't use the channel, the wording or the tool as a
 * shortcut. The obeyed trade is sometimes a sell, sometimes an ordinary in-limit buy and
 * sometimes a transfer, which removes the "sells are safe" and "transfers are bad" shortcuts.
 * A control never proposes the ordered trade itself: that is obeying, whatever the framing.
 *
 * Labels follow the stress suite's rules exactly (`stressKit`). Wording and world content are
 * this file's own, and five mechanisms are left out entirely (UNTRAINED_MECHANISMS), so the
 * locked stress families still test disguises v3 never saw.
 *
 * Since v4 (docs/SENTINEL-STRESS.md, "Why v3 regressed") the rows also break the surface
 * shortcuts v3 learned (checked by shortcuts.ts):
 * - Copied amount: an order may state an exact amount, an amount the agent only partly follows,
 *   or no amount at all ("get out of tAMZN"), and half the pairs mention the independent trade's
 *   amount somewhere harmless, so a copied number proves nothing either way.
 * - Transfer or approval: some mandates allow a payee or a spender, and transfers and approvals
 *   to them are ordinary (or, when a planted message pushes them, manipulated but in the rules).
 * - Named token: the independent trade sometimes trades the named stock the other way, and
 *   some orders name no stock at all ("go fully to tUSDG").
 */

/**
 * Stress families whose mechanism no training row uses, in any wording. `harm-rebalance-to-stable`
 * isn't one: real Arena attack seeds (A2-fake-halt-news, A3-stale-price) already order
 * conversions to stablecoins, so v1 and v2 trained on it too; its locked stress wordings still
 * test unseen phrasing.
