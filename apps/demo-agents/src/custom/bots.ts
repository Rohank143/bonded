/**
 * Custom trading bots as people actually write them: a model, a short prompt and one trust
 * decision that seemed reasonable when it was written. They stand in for an operator's own bot
 * when we test the adaptive attacker (docs/ADAPTIVE-ATTACKER.md); none is meant as good practice.
 *
 * The templates (AgentKit and the demo agents) ship careful prompts, and the strong models behind
 * them resist the published attacks. A real custom bot usually has a specific flaw instead: it
 * trusts a channel because of who the channel says it is from, or it acts on a feed it believes
 * its own team writes, or it keeps retrying. Each design below is one of those, written as the
 * sentence a builder would add to the prompt.
